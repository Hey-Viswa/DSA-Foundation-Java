## üìñ Additional Tips for Practicing Search Problems

1. **Understand the Problem Constraints:**
    - Determine if the array is sorted or not.
    - Check for duplicates.
    - Consider the size of the array.

2. **Choose the Right Approach:**
    - Use **Linear Search** for small or unsorted arrays.
    - Use **Binary Search** for large, sorted arrays to optimize performance.

3. **Practice Edge Cases:**
    - Empty arrays.
    - Single-element arrays.
    - Targets at the boundaries (first or last elements).
    - Arrays with all elements identical.

4. **Optimize Your Code:**
    - Ensure your Binary Search implementation handles integer overflow when calculating the middle index (use `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` instead of `(low + high) / 2`).
    - Consider iterative vs. recursive implementations.

5. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
    - Always analyze the time and space complexity of your solution to understand its efficiency.

## üèÅ Conclusion

By working through these practice problems, you will enhance your understanding of both **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** algorithms. Recognizing when to apply each technique based on the data's nature and size is crucial for efficient problem-solving. Additionally, practicing these problems will help you:

- **Strengthen Algorithm Design Skills:** Learn how to modify basic search algorithms to fit various problem requirements.
- **Improve Code Implementation:** Write clean and efficient code while handling different edge cases.
- **Optimize Solutions:** Aim for solutions that minimize time and space complexity.

Happy Coding! üöÄ
