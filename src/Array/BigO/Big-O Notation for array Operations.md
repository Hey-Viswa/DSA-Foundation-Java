# 🚀 **Big-O Notation for Array Operations**

Understanding the time complexity of array operations is essential for designing efficient algorithms. **Big-O notation** describes the upper bound of the time an operation takes relative to the input size, providing a clear understanding of performance.

## 🛠️ **Insertion Operations**

### 1️⃣ **Insert at End (Append)** ➡️ **O(1)** *(Amortized)*
- **Why:**
    - If there is space, inserting at the end is a direct operation.
    - If the array is full, resizing is required:
        - A new array is created.
        - All elements are copied to the new array (**O(n)**).
    - Resizing happens **infrequently**, so the **amortized time complexity** is **O(1)**.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before Insert:
[1, 2, 3, _, _]    (Size: 3, Capacity: 5)

After Insert '4' at End:
[1, 2, 3, 4, _]    (Size: 4, Capacity: 5)

If Full (Resized):
Before: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After Resize: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, _, _, _, _]
```
---

### 2️⃣ **Insert at Start** ⬅️ **O(n)**
- **Why:**
    - All existing elements must be shifted one position to the **right** to make space for the new element at the start.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before Insert:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Insert '0' at Start (Shift Right):
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
---

### 3️⃣ **Insert at Arbitrary Position** 📍 **O(n)**
- **Why:**
    - Similar to inserting at the start:
        - Elements from the insertion point to the end must be **shifted** to accommodate the new element.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before Insert:
[1, 2, 3, 5]

Insert '4' at Position 3:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
(Elements shifted right after position 3)
```

---

## 🗑️ **Deletion Operations**

### 1️⃣ **Delete from End** ➡️ **O(1)**
- **Why:**
    - Simply reduces the size counter.
    - No shifting of elements is required.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before Delete:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Delete from End:
[1, 2, 3]
```
---

### 2️⃣ **Delete from Start** ⬅️ **O(n)**
- **Why:**
    - All elements must be shifted one position to the **left** to fill the gap left by the removed element.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before Delete:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Delete '1' from Start (Shift Left):
[2, 3, 4]
```
---

### 3️⃣ **Delete from Arbitrary Position** 📍 **O(n)**
- **Why:**
    - Similar to deletion from the start:
        - Elements after the deletion point must be **shifted left** to maintain order.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Before Delete:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Delete Element at Position 2 (Value '3'):
[1, 2, 4, 5]
(Elements shifted left after position 2)
```

---

## 🔍 **Searching Operations**

### 1️⃣ **Search by Value** 🔎 **O(n)**
- **Why:**
    - In the **worst case**, you may need to inspect **every element** to find the desired value.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Search for '3' in Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
Check: 1 -> 2 -> 3 (Found at Position 2)
```
---

### 2️⃣ **Access by Index** 🎯 **O(1)**
- **Why:**
    - Arrays allow **direct access** to an element by its index:
        - The memory address of the element is calculated directly using its index, enabling immediate access.

#### **Visual Representation:**
```
Access Index 2 in Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
Value: 3
```

Time Complexity for Array Operations:

   Insert at End:       O(1)
   Insert at Start:     O(n)
   Insert Arbitrary:    O(n)
   Delete from End:     O(1)
   Delete from Start:   O(n)
   Delete Arbitrary:    O(n)
   Search by Value:     O(n)
   Access by Index:     O(1)
```

## 🚀 **Key Takeaways**
- Arrays provide **constant-time access** for indexed elements.
- Insertions and deletions at the start or middle involve **shifting elements**, making them **O(n)** operations.
- Resizing an array (in dynamic arrays) has a cost of **O(n)** but happens rarely, giving **amortized O(1)** performance for appends.

Understanding these complexities will help you write more efficient algorithms and optimize performance when working with arrays!
