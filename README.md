## 🗓️ **Month-by-Month Breakdown**

### 📆 **Month 1: Foundations and Basic Data Structures**

**🎯 Goals:** Build a strong foundation with basic data structures and programming concepts.

**🛠️ Topics:**
- **Week 1:**
  - Select a programming language (**Java, C++, Python**).
  - Learn syntax, loops, functions, and data types.
  - Solve simple coding problems like reversing a string.
- **Weeks 2-3:**
  - **Arrays:** Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search) and Sorting basics.
  - **Linked Lists:** Singly and Doubly Linked Lists (Insertion, Deletion).
- **Week 4:**
  - **Stacks & Queues:** Basic operations (Push/Pop, Enqueue/Dequeue).
  - **Hash Maps:** Intro to hash functions and collision handling.

✅ **Practice:** Solve **25+ problems** on arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

---

### 📆 **Month 2: Deep Dive into Core Data Structures**

**🎯 Goals:** Learn and understand advanced data structures.

**🛠️ Topics:**
- **Weeks 5-6:**
  - **Trees:** Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), Tree Traversals.
  - **Heaps:** Min-Heap, Max-Heap, and Heapify operations.
- **Weeks 7-8:**
  - **Graphs:**
    - Representations: Adjacency List/Matrix.
    - Traversals: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search).

✅ **Practice:** Solve **30+ problems** on Trees, Heaps, and Graphs.
