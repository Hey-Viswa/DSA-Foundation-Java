## üìÖ High-Level Timeline: 6-Month DSA Plan

- **Month 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Foundations and Basic Data Structures
- **Month 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Deep Dive into Core Data Structures
- **Month 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Advanced Data Structures & Fundamental Algorithms
- **Month 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Core Algorithmic Paradigms
- **Month 5 (Weeks 17-20):** Complex Problem-Solving and Optimization
- **Month 6 (Weeks 21-24):** Full-Fledged Interview Preparation & Mock Sessions

Each month builds on the previous one, covering topics progressively to ensure a strong foundation and mastery of concepts.
